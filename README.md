# Icons-to-folders

A batch script allowing for quick and mass adding of icons to folders

How does it work?

Simply select all the folders you want to change the icons for and move them to the "IconsToFolders.bat" script. Then move the folder with the icons to the cmd window. The names of the icons should be the same as the names of the folders.The gif below shows how the script works.
